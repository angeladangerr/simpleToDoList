A simple to-do list website following the Coding Artist's tutorial on YouTube! Changed the colors and icons to match my own preference (went for a strawberry matcha theme)! 

This to-do list website includes:
- A textbox to enter tasks
- A "+" button to add the task
- Strikethrough when clicking on the task to "mark as complete"
- A delete button to delete the task from the list
